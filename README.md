CMS made with Object Pascal for Web

## A little history
This project is old and no longer maintained. It is a (almost) full CMS made with Object Pascal with fpWeb. The backend is a CGI application and the frontend is all done with HTML, CSS and JavaScript themes.

The project is posted here for future reference or for the ones who want to start something like it. IN ANY WAYS THIS PROJECT HAS GOOD PROGRAMMING PRACTICES OR QUALITY CODE!
